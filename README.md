## Mememan 3
Partial implementation of Nintendo's Megaman 3 for Chrome/Safari created with
LiveScript, Processing.js and Node.js. I made this project from scratch in 3
days for a freelance and decided it was worth saving because it is so fun <3 If
you press start, there is a Pokétrainer alt costume and you can campture the
enemy monsters and use them as Pokémon.

Wish I had more time for that kind of stuff.

Live demo at http://lambda.wiki/mememan - takes some time to load all assets.
